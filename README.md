Lynx (WIP)
======

Lynx is a script to set up an Linux laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholasadamou/lynx/master/lynx
less lynx
sh lynx 2>&1 | tee ~/lynx.log
```

Optionally, [install nicholasadamou/dotfiles][dotfiles].

[dotfiles]: https://github.com/nicholasadamou/dotfiles

Debugging
---------

Your last lynx run will be saved to `~/lynx.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nicholasadamou/lynx/issues/new) for me.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.
